## 🔓 Open Dev — SelkaSense AI Functions

Below are the core AI modules that power SelkaSense’s predictive risk engine.  
Each function is designed to detect, forecast, or interpret on-chain instability before it manifests.

### 🔎 1. RiskRadar — Token Instability Prediction

```javascript
function riskRadar(tokenData) {
  const priceVolatility = tokenData.currentPrice - tokenData.previousPrice;
  const priceHistoryScore = Math.abs(priceVolatility / tokenData.previousPrice);

  if (priceHistoryScore > 0.1) {
    return 'Alert: Token Instability Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Token Stable';
  }
}
```
#### What it does: Compares current and previous token prices to detect sharp deviations.
#### Why it matters: Spikes over 10% often indicate manipulation, panic movement, or instability.

### 🌐 2. PulseTrack — Market Seismic Analysis

```javascript
function pulseTrack(marketData) {
  const volatilityIndex = marketData.totalVolume / marketData.transactionFrequency;
  const marketShiftFactor = marketData.priceChange / volatilityIndex;

  if (Math.abs(marketShiftFactor) > 0.3) {
    return 'Alert: Major Market Shift Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Market Stable';
  }
}
```
#### What it does: Measures seismic movement in market structure using price vs volume/frequency ratios.
#### Why it matters: Flags disproportionate price actions unsupported by liquidity — often a manipulation signal.

### ⚠️ 3. VolatilityPredict — Advanced Risk Forecasting

```javascript
function volatilityPredict(tokenData) {
  const priceChange = Math.abs(tokenData.currentPrice - tokenData.previousPrice);
  const liquidityImpact = tokenData.liquidityFactor / tokenData.marketDepth;

  const volatilityRisk = priceChange * liquidityImpact;

  if (volatilityRisk > 0.5) {
    return 'Alert: High Risk of Volatility';
  } else {
    return 'Risk Level Low';
  }
}
```
#### What it does: Forecasts volatility by weighing price movement against liquidity depth.
#### Why it matters: Critical for identifying conditions where small moves can create massive ripple effects.

### 🧭 4. TrendShift — Early Market Shift Identification

```javascript
function trendShift(marketData) {
  const historicalTrend = (marketData.previousPrice * marketData.previousVolume) / 1000;
  const trendDeviation = (marketData.currentPrice - historicalTrend) / historicalTrend;

  if (Math.abs(trendDeviation) > 0.05) {
    return 'Alert: Early Trend Shift Identified';
  } else {
    return 'Trend Stable';
  }
}
```
#### What it does: Detects early deviations from trend trajectories using historical volume-price patterns.
#### Why it matters: Gives users a head start on directional market shifts — before they become obvious.

### 💧 5. LiquidityFlow — Real-Time Liquidity Monitoring

```javascript
function liquidityFlow(marketData) {
  const liquidityRatio = marketData.tokenVolume / marketData.marketLiquidity;

  if (liquidityRatio < 0.05) {
    return 'Alert: Low Liquidity Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Liquidity Flow Normal';
  }
}
```
#### What it does: Assesses how much real token activity backs the market’s liquidity.
#### Why it matters: Highlights potential traps — where exits may be blocked due to illiquidity.
