## 🚀 Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1 — MVP (Launched)

Our core detection engine is live and pulsing with real-time data:

- 🔎 **RiskRadar** — Predict token instability through behavioral pattern scans
- 🌐 **PulseTrack** — Analyze seismic shifts in market structure and liquidity
- ⚠️ **VolatilityPredict** — Forecast high-risk events with advanced AI modeling
- 🧭 **TrendShift** — Detect early directional changes before the market reacts

📅 **Released:** Q3 2025

### 🌀 Phase 2 — Current Cycle (Q3–Q4 2025)

We’re expanding Selka’s sensitivity to subtle liquidity movements and signal patterns:

- 💧 **LiquidityFlow** — Monitor deep liquidity dynamics across tokens in real time
- 🚀 **SignalBoost** — Amplify alert precision with enhanced anomaly scoring
- 🛡 **FlowGuard** — AI-powered detection for unstable or manipulated liquidity pools
- 🧱 **StabilityGuard** — Long-range analysis of token health and market sustainability

📅 **In Progress:** June–August 2025

### 🔮 Phase 3 — Upcoming (Q1 2026 and beyond)

Future upgrades will include:

- Advanced AI overlays  
- Predictive simulation engines  
- Full cross-chain adaptation and risk synchronization  

Selka evolves as the chain does — stay tuned.

## 🧠 AI Functionality

SelkaSense includes five core AI modules designed to detect market instability and token-specific risk in real time.

### 🔎 1. RiskRadar — Token Instability Prediction

```javascript
function riskRadar(tokenData) {
  const priceVolatility = tokenData.currentPrice - tokenData.previousPrice;
  const priceHistoryScore = Math.abs(priceVolatility / tokenData.previousPrice);

  if (priceHistoryScore > 0.1) {
    return 'Alert: Token Instability Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Token Stable';
  }
}
```

**What it does:**  
Analyzes price volatility by comparing current and previous token prices.  
**Why it matters:**  
Flags abnormal price movements exceeding 10% — often a signal of manipulation or instability.

### 🌐 2. PulseTrack — Market Seismic Analysis

```javascript
function pulseTrack(marketData) {
  const volatilityIndex = marketData.totalVolume / marketData.transactionFrequency;
  const marketShiftFactor = marketData.priceChange / volatilityIndex;

  if (Math.abs(marketShiftFactor) > 0.3) {
    return 'Alert: Major Market Shift Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Market Stable';
  }
}
```

**What it does:**  
Calculates a volatility index from volume and frequency, then compares it to price changes.  
**Why it matters:**  
Detects price swings unsupported by volume — a potential red flag for artificial movement.

### ⚠️ 3. VolatilityPredict — Advanced Risk Forecasting

```javascript
function volatilityPredict(tokenData) {
  const priceChange = Math.abs(tokenData.currentPrice - tokenData.previousPrice);
  const liquidityImpact = tokenData.liquidityFactor / tokenData.marketDepth;

  const volatilityRisk = priceChange * liquidityImpact;

  if (volatilityRisk > 0.5) {
    return 'Alert: High Risk of Volatility';
  } else {
    return 'Risk Level Low';
  }
}
```

**What it does:**  
Forecasts turbulence by factoring in price movement and liquidity conditions.  
**Why it matters:**  
Useful for identifying tokens where even small moves may trigger large reactions in illiquid environments.

### 🧭 4. TrendShift — Early Market Shift Identification

```javascript
function trendShift(marketData) {
  const historicalTrend = (marketData.previousPrice * marketData.previousVolume) / 1000;
  const trendDeviation = (marketData.currentPrice - historicalTrend) / historicalTrend;

  if (Math.abs(trendDeviation) > 0.05) {
    return 'Alert: Early Trend Shift Identified';
  } else {
    return 'Trend Stable';
  }
}
```

**What it does:**  
Compares current price/volume data to historical baselines.  
**Why it matters:**  
Spots subtle deviations that may signal trend reversals before they become visible to the broader market.

### 💧 5. LiquidityFlow — Real-Time Liquidity Monitoring

```javascript
function liquidityFlow(marketData) {
  const liquidityRatio = marketData.tokenVolume / marketData.marketLiquidity;

  if (liquidityRatio < 0.05) {
    return 'Alert: Low Liquidity Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Liquidity Flow Normal';
  }
}
```

**What it does:**  
Tracks how much actual token volume backs the available liquidity.  
**Why it matters:**  
Detects thin markets where exit liquidity is low — crucial for avoiding traps and slippage.
